            Created in 2012 by teenager Ben Francis and a group of his
            high-school friends. Gymshark has grown from a screen printing
            operation in a garage, into one of the fastest growing and most
            recognisable brands in fitness. This growth comes from a devotion to
            producing innovative, effective performance wear and an
            ever-expanding social presence, and above all a commitment to the
            Gymshark vision

            Add rice and stir very gently to distribute. Top with artichokes and
            peppers, and cook without stirring, until most of the liquid is
            absorbed, 15 to 18 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low, add reserved
            shrimp and mussels, tucking them down into the rice, and cook again
            without stirring, until mussels have opened and rice is just tender,
            5 to 7 minutes more. (Discard any mussels that donâ€™t open.)
